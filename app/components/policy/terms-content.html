<h3>1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES, GENERAL INFORMATION AND SERVICES FEATURES.</h3>
Helperbit is a platform that allows NPOs, civil protections, municipalities, hospitals and other public organizations to sign up and collect funds addressed to social and public initiatives. These bodies can receive donations in 2 different ways: 1) through the distribution algorithm linked with a specific event, when they are affected or involved in the relief during a natural disaster; 2) through direct donations when they create specific projects. 
Allowed methods of payments: 1) bitcoin; 2) Credit, Debit and Prepaid Card supported by MistralPay Ltd. The beneficiaries receive bitcoin that they can spend and withdraw. In order to exchange the cryptocurrency in local currency they have to use an external service. Helperbit is not responsible for any mistake or loss.
Registered single Users can be added as possible beneficiaries and receive direct donations if they are affected by a natural disaster (among those currently provided by the platform).
Helperbit currently provides two kinds of multisignature wallets:
- the first solution is for single Users: it’s a 2of3 multisignature wallet where the User owns 2 keys, while Helperbit has only 1 key.
- the second one is for organizations and bodies: it’s a 3of4 multisignature wallet where the administrators of the organization have 3 keys, while Helperbit has only 1 key.
Helperbit also provides public information about natural disaster events, taking data from third party services, while other information are internally elaborated, starting from raw data. Helperbit does not take any responsibility if there are mistakes and does not recommend the use of such information for other purposes.

Making a financial donation you guarantee that you have the full ownership and control over the donation amount, it is free from all liens or encumbrances, and does not exist on the donation amount any legal dispute or other. So when making the donation, you donate pure and free the amount to the selected beneficiaries (and Helperbit s.r.l. could be included as recipient), which accept this act of liberality. Also in accordance with the current legislation, the donation is irrevocable.
<br>

<br>
<h3>5. ACCURACY OF INFORMATION</h3>
You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You acknowledge and agree that Helperbit can not be responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Bitcoin transaction initiated via the Services. For instance, if you mistype a wallet address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection with any transaction request to send bitcoins via the Service, the bitcoins will be sent to whatever wallet address or information you provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction request details carefully before completing any transaction requests via the Services 
<br>
<h3>6. PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
Your privacy is important to us. We only share your information with third parties as outlined in our Privacy and Cookies Policy or required to do so by law enforcement, court order, or in compliance with legal reporting obligations. 

Helperbit aims to reasonably identify each User by cross-checking User data with third party identity verification and authentication services. If a User or a User’s transaction is flagged as suspicious through our internal controls, Helperbit will require additional proof of identification from the User and has the right to not permit the access into the platform until additional and verifiable proof of identity is received and the Compliance Officer has approved the User for use of the Platform. 

By agreeing to our Terms, you acknowledge and understand that Helperbit maintains verification levels which require User participation and verification. You accept that you may not be able to achieve a desired level of verification, and Helperbit reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, the appropriate Verification Level for any User, as well as the right to downgrade Users without prior notice. Helperbit may, from time to time, implement policies restricting Verification Levels by nationality, country of residence, or any other factor. This may affect your ability to withdraw funds in your account directly from the platform (but it will be possible by exporting the passphrase) and you indemnify Helperbit against any losses associated with an inability to deposit and/or withdraw funds based on your verification level. 
<br>
<h3>7. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET</h3>
The transmission of data or information (including communications by e-mail) over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks may be subject to possible loss, interception, or alteration while in transit. While Helperbit will take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to Helperbit and will process such information in accordance with Helperbit's Privacy and cookies Policy.
<br>
<h3>8. CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS REQUESTS</h3>
All bitcoin transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the bitcoin public ledger via the bitcoin distributed consensus network (“Verification Network”), which is not owned, controlled or operated by Helperbit. The Services help you submit your bitcoin transaction request for confirmation to the Verification Network. However, the bitcoin network, including the Verification Network, is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Helperbit has no control over the bitcoin network, including the Verification Network, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Verification Network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Verification Network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Verification Network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services. 

Once submitted to the cryptocurrency network, a bitcoin transaction will be considered unconfirmed for a period of time that is equal to at least 1 confirmation (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or more). A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Bitcoin associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Helperbit balance. 
Before doing an output transaction, at least 1 confirmation by the Verification Network is required. 
The platform is able to confirm to a recipient an incoming donation (input tx) after at least 1 confirmation by the Verification Network. 
Once a transaction is signed, it is possible to continue to sign from the same wallet without any delay any other transaction, but if the previous transaction is not accepted by the Verification Network then also the following transactions are deleted.

Helperbit cannot reverse a bitcoin transaction which has been communicated to and confirmed by the bitcoin network. 
Helperbit has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party. Helperbit is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with bitcoin transferred using Helperbit, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must handle it directly with that third party. Any bitcoin transaction conducted using Helperbit is final regardless of any defects in or non-delivery of any goods or services purchased in connection with such bitcoin transaction, or any other aspect of your transaction or relationship with the relevant third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Helperbit Support so that we may consider whether to take any action. 

Helperbit process bitcoin Transaction according to the instructions received from its Users and we do not guarantee 100% the identity of any User, receiver, requester or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to Helperbit as the relevant bitcoin Transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated. 

If you initiate a bitcoin Transaction by entering the recipient's bitcoin address, Helperbit will confirm that the bitcoin address is valid; however, Helperbit cannot 100% confirm that the bitcoin address belongs to the intended recipient. 

The risk of loss in holding bitcoin can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to hold cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of bitcoin can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. 
<br>
<h3>9. NO CANCELLATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS</h3>
Once a transaction request has been submitted to the bitcoin Verification Network via the Services, the Verification Network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. Helperbit has no control over the bitcoin Verification Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. As a result, all transaction requests initiated via the Services are irreversible. 
<br>

<br>
<h3>17. User CONDUCT AND OBLIGATIONS</h3>
In connection with your use of the Services, you will not: 

Violate or assist any party in violating any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or any rule of any self-regulatory or similar organization of which you are or are required to be a member through your use of the Services; Provide false, inaccurate or misleading information; Infringe upon Helperbit’s or any third party’s copyright, patent, trademark, or intellectual property rights; Distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, any junk mail, spam, or chain letters; Reverse engineer or disassemble any aspect of the Site or Services in an effort to access any source code, underlying ideas and concepts, and algorithms; Take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, or detrimentally interfere with, intercept, or expropriate any system, data, or information; Transmit or upload any material to the Site that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, or any other harmful or deleterious programs; Otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site, other Helperbit Accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Site, through password mining or any other means; or Transfer any rights granted to you under these Terms. 
<br>
<h3>18. TRANSFERABILITY</h3>
While the Account and the Services provided to a User are not transferable under any circumstance and shall be used only by the User, Helperbit shall have the right to transfer, assign, or sell all the rights, benefits, or obligations to any person and these Terms shall continue to be in force and effect for the benefit of the successors and assigns of Helperbit. 
<br>
<h3>19. PERMANENT WITHDRAWAL OF SERVICE</h3>
Helperbit may (a) suspend or terminate your access to the Services, and (b) deactivate or cancel your Account as required by a valid subpoena or court order, or if Helperbit reasonably suspects you of using your Account in furtherance of illegal activity. If any transaction is in a pending state at the time your Account is cancelled or suspended, such transaction may be cancelled and/or refunded as appropriate. You may not cancel your Account to evade an investigation or avoid paying any amounts otherwise due to Helperbit. In the event that you or Helperbit terminates this agreement or your access to the Services, or deactivates or cancels your Account, you will remain liable for all amounts due hereunder. In the event that a technical problem causes system outage or account errors, Helperbit may temporarily suspend access to your Account until the problem is resolved. 
<br>
<h3>20. OWNERSHIP OF FUNDS</h3>
You hereby certify to us that any funds used by you in connection with the Platform are either owned by you or that you are validly authorized to carry out transactions using such funds, and that all transactions initiated with your Account are for your own account and not on behalf of any other person or entity. 
<br>
<h3>21. REFUND POLICY</h3>
Given the irreversibility of bitcoin transactions, we cannot provide refund or return on any bitcoin transaction that happens directly between Users in the platform.

Most of the Credit, Debit and Prepaid Card Issuers allow card holders to chargeback authorised and settled transactions by requesting a chargeback from the Issuing Bank.
When a donation is made using Credit, Debit or Prepaid Cards, the amount is exchanged in bitcoin and sent to the Users (the beneficiaries could be Single User, Organization or other bodies) in a bitcoin transaction. As this operation is irreversible, Helperbit has the right to ask to the beneficiaries to refund the same bitcoin amount sent to them. Each User that receives a controversial transaction agrees to pay Helperbit the outstanding amount immediately on demand. Helperbit reserves the right to automatically debit such outstanding amounts from any deposits that the User subsequently makes to their own Account or received donation. Helperbit shall be entitled to charge the customer for any reasonable expenses we incur as a result of any negative balance on the customer’s Account.
Helperbit reserves the right, at any time, to send to the customer reminders or to take other debt collection measures including but not limited to mandating a debt collection agency or solicitors or to pursue the claim in court. Helperbit reserves the right to charge to the customer the expenses that Helperbit reasonably incurs in connection with any such debt collection or enforcement efforts. This provision shall survive termination of the relationship between the User and Helperbit.
<br>
<h3>22. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Helperbit, its affiliates and service providers, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees, and representatives, harmless from any claim or demand (including attorneys’ fees and costs and any fines, fees or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your use of Services, or (iii) your violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or the rights of any third party. 
<br>
<h3>23. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
Helperbit provides no guarantee as to the performance or the uninterrupted availability of the services. The services are provided on an "as is," "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Helperbit disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement with respect to the services. Helperbit does not represent or warrant that the services and the information contained therein are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. Helperbit will make reasonable efforts to ensure that transactions on the platform are processed in a timely fashion, but makes no representations or warranties with respect to the amount of time needed to process such transactions. Because cryptocurrency transfers on and off the platform are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, Helperbit makes no representations or warranties regarding the success of, or the amount of time needed for, cryptocurrency transactions. 

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied terms in contracts with consumers, so some or all of the disclaimers in this section may not apply to you. 
<br>
<h3>24. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Helperbit shall have no liability for any damages of any kind (including without limitation indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or tort damages, or lost profits) in connection with your use of the services, even if Helperbit has been advised or is aware of the possibility of such damages. 
<br>
<h3>25. APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE</h3>

You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms. 
<br>
<h3>26. ARBITRATION</h3>
Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under your use of the Services shall be finally settled on an individual basis through confidential, binding arbitration in accordance to the rules of the Arbitration Centre of the Italian Chamber of Commerce for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Helperbit hereby expressly waive trial by jury. The arbitration shall take place in the Italian State, in the Italian language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. Additionally, you hereby waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. 
<br>
<h3>27. SURVIVAL</h3>
Sections 15 (Third Party Content), 22 (Indemnification), 23 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 24 (Limitation on Liability), 25 (Applicable Law and Venue), 27 (Survival), 28 (Severability), and 30 (Force Majeure and Fortuitous Events) will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms. 
<br>
<h3>28. SEVERABILITY</h3>
If any provision of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. 
<br>
<h3>29. INTEGRATION</h3>
The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

In addition to applicable disclaimers stated above, Helperbit's performance under these Terms shall be excused in the event of interruption and/or delay due to, or resulting from, causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited, acts of any government, war or other hostility, civil disorder, natural disasters, explosion, embargo, acts of terrorism, power failure, equipment failure, industrial or labor disputes or controversies, acts of any third party data provider(s) or other third party information provider(s), third party software, or communication method interruptions. 
<br>
<h3>31. GOVERNING LANGUAGE AND TRANSLATIONS</h3>
You agree that these Terms, Helperbit's Privacy Policy and other notices posted through the Services have been drafted in English. Although translations in other languages of any of the foregoing documents may be available, such translations may not be up to date or complete. Accordingly, you agree that in the event of any conflict between the English language version of the foregoing documents and any other translations thereto, the English language version of such documents shall govern. 
<br>
