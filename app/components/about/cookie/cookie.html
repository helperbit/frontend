	<h1 class="border-bottom border-yellow" translate>What are cookies?</h1>
	<br>
	<p translate>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the
		site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and
		other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come
		back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>

	<h1 class="border-bottom border-yellow" translate>How do we use cookies?</h1>

	<ul>
		<li translate>Track the user traffic in the platform with a third-party service (google analytics)</li>
		<li translate>Record your preferences (like currency and language)</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<br>

	<h1 class="border-bottom border-yellow" translate>How to control cookies?</h1>

			href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">aboutcookies.org</a>. You can delete all cookies that are already on
		your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may
		have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may
		not work.</p>
